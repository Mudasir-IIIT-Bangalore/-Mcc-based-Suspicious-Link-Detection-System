# Mcc-based-Suspicious-Link-Detection
Dataset and source code used in research paper entitled "Mutual Clustering Coefficient-based Suspicious-link Detection Approach for Online Social Networks  "


Dataset file: Data set containing similarity between friend pair based on features viz "  f2 -> work(w), f3-> education(e), f4-> home_town(ht) and f5-> current_city(cc) " along with label [Suspicious | Normal]. 
f1 -> holds the value for Mutual_clustering_Coefficient(Mcc).



Link_list(edges) file contains the information about the connected uesrs pairs in the collected data. This file has been used to extract the information of only the connected users (friends) and their mutual connections.
